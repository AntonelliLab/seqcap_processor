    "In order to extract the contigs representing your target sequences (the sequences that were being captured during the sequence capture process), you need to provide a fasta file containing the reference sequences for all loci of interest. Ususally all sequences of interest should be present in the file that was used to design the RNA baits for sequence capture. If you are using some standarad RNA bait library that was not specifically designed for your organism group/project (e.g. [Ultraconserved Elements - UCEs](http://ultraconserved.org/)), you can usually find the reference library on the webpage of the developer or in the respective publication. If all else fails, you can try to extract sequences of the same loci that you captured, for organisms that are closely related to your taxa, e.g. from [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)."

    "Before running the script, you should take a look at the fasta headers in your reference fasta file. The script will use the fasta headers to extract the locus names. By default it takes the complete fasta header as the locus name. However, in many cases there is a lot of information in the fasta headers which you may not want to keep and translate as locus names (e.g. **>RPB2_intron23 Geonoma weberbaueri RNA polymerase II second largest subunit** should preferably translate into the locus name **RPB2_intron23** and discard all the rest of the header). If your fasta sequences are named consistently you can define a [regular expression](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html), using the `--regex` flag in order to only use the part of the string you are interested in. You can only define a single regex for the whole fasta file, which will be applied to all fasta headers in the same way.\n",

    "Those fields containing a '1' indicate that a unique match was extracted for the respective exon and sample. If the output reveals a very low harvest of target sequences, you can try to reduce the values for the flags `--min-coverage` and `--min-identity` in order to be more generous in the matching step. If on the other hand your output turns out to capture a lot of non-homologous sequences between the different samples (can be identified after the [alignment step](align_contigs.ipynb)), you may want to turn up the values for these flags in order to be more conservative in your search."

Also state again, which assembler was used to generate the contigs.
